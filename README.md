# Terrorist Detection-3
2D graphics technology: used SVG/html5 canvas for your 2D graphics technology. Used the d3.js gallery KineticJS and adapted it for my site.
CRUD operations: Graphics component provided functionality for users to create, retrieve, update, and delete data from database. The user must be able to interact directly with the graphics to perform these actions. For example, if there is a visualization of a network, the user could click a node in the visualization to reveal a panel for editing or deleting that node.

Documentation: For this project, have included a summary document with my submission. In this document, will first include instructions for setting up my software on a local machine (assume XAMPP is available).
The findings have included answers to the
following questions:
1) Who are the key suspicious persons?
2) What are they attacking targets?
3) When will their planned attacks happen?
Screenshots from your web application to support answers. For example, if my answer says that PERSON X is the lead of the terrorists, then there is evidence from my app to support make this claim (e.g., in my app, the PERSON X is the center of a social network and text in the related documents were highlight).
