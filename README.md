# Terrorist Detection-3
2D graphics technology:
SVG/html5 canvas for 2D graphics. Used the d3.js gallery KineticJS and adapted it for my site.
CRUD operations: Graphics component provided functionality for users to create, retrieve, update, and delete data from database. The user must be able to interact directly with the graphics to perform these actions. 
For example, if there is a visualization of a network, the user could click a node in the visualization to reveal a panel for editing or deleting that node.
The findings have included answers to the following questions:
1) Who are the key suspicious persons?
2) What are they attacking targets?
3) When will their planned attacks happen?
